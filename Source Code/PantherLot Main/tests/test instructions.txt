Instructions for Tests
------------------------------------------
The tests will be placed in this package following the same directory structure
as the main source files.

Example:

src
	server.storage
		ParkingSpot.java

test
	server.storage
		ParkingSpotTest.java
		
		

Instruction on how to structure the tests will be found in code comments in the
ParkingSpotTest.java

NOTE:
ALL TESTS MUST CONTAIN SETUP METHODS (TEARDOWN NOT EXACTLY NECESSARY I THINK)
